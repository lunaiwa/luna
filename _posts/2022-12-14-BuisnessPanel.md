Hosted a fork of GitLab and had about a hundred thousand repositories when they left. Wanted to use information to predict when to arcive and delete repositories. Wanted to know when to delete reposisotires since they were expensive</p>

<p>P - the most useful overtime is continuous learning, not just learning a particular programing language and all companies have different stats and leanr different. All companies have a different way of doing things, don't be super concerned about things on the news and learning the skill to learn computer systems is fulfilling. As long as I go to a job for 6 months then as long as I learn it's ok. Everything falls into place and in tech it is in high demand.</p>

<p>B - 100% continous learning and be adaptive. Carrer path is zigzaggy and jus be adaptive. The best technical person ever workng with is someone who listens to requriements and translate it into how it can slove the requirments in tech.</p>

<p>B - close to 14 years at Qualcome and is a semiconducotr industry and went through aqusisitions, learned going through aquisitions and Qualcome went out and took small companies "Serial Aquires" to be adaptive and always continous learning and if you keep those things you will be fine</p>

<p>P - formal training of their own data and code becuase you can't just find it on the internet omehwere and all these things you can learn, you can't learn that way but you have to be affective at the job. Open source framework called enable, they make their own thing since they have to learn how to write a service. A monorepo, everything in the backend sits in this one reposistory and you have to be able to effectivly navigate and learn how to use this.</p>

<p>B - friends were academicall softwear but they all move to somewhere in non tech and code. Learning to code is a way o thinking, disecting and learning. How to problem solve. Interveiwing is hard but when you are being interveiwed you are tested with problem solving and why you reach the conclusion that you did . "In a room with whiteboard, notepad, and pen 'how many cars are in the US". Doesn''t care about the answer but just the method that you did to get there. Understanding patters and learning techniques.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter where you go or major in because Computer Science teaches more then coding. It teaches someone how to adapt and problem solve in idfferent situations and it can teach lifelong lessons which can help you in a future carrer. Like the speakers said today, they all had different paths and they never expected to end up doing compute science, so it doesn't matter where you are right now, just adapt and explore.</p>
